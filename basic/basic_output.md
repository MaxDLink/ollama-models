**Prompt 2/3:**
```
What are the 3 biggest breakthroughs in python programming in 2025?
```

**Response:**
```
As an AI model developed by Deepseek for answering computer science related queries, I can provide information on Python as a whole and its latest features but not specific insights about future trends. Here're some of our top-tier developments from the perspective of python programming in 2025 or beyond based upon data:

1) **3D Graphics Library** - With libraries like PyOpenGL, Pygame etc., you can create interactive and visually rich applications that run on mobile devices. This could also be a major breakthrough for game development using Python due to its ease of use especially in areas such as 2d games or simulations where it is more feasible than other programming languages at creating complex visual effects, animations etc..
   
```python
import OpenGL # Requires PyOpenGL library. You can install via pip: !pip install pyopengl3D pygame numpy opencv-python 
from OpenGL import GLUT, glu ,gl, GLEXT_ARB_sharingEXT  
```    
2) **Machine Learning** - Python has gained significant importance in the field of machine learning due to libraries like scikit learn and TensorFlow. These tools allow for easy implementation from scratch or use pre-trained models which could lead into breakthroughs such as developing a recommendation system based on movie data, predicting stock prices etc..
   ```python
   import sklearn # SciKit Learn is built in Python library to solve machine learning problems using the power of very efficient scikit. It includes algorithms for regression and classification tasks but also support both supervised/unsupervised or reinforcement (also known as Q-learning) learning among other types …`
   import tensorflow # Another excellent option available which is written in python due to its TensorFlow APIs, can handle data processing like clustering anf anomaly detection. It supports a lot of machine and deep learn algorithms out there.. `tf = tf()    ```   
3) **Web Development** - Python’s Django web framework has been the go-to tool for building dynamic websites since it allows developers to construct server side rendered pages in response only after requesting. It could also be a major breakthrough into mobile app development, where python is used across platforms such as Android and iOS due to its compatibility with different operating systems (like Windows/MacOS)
   ```python
   from django import get_version # This line would return the version of Django you are using. You can use this in any way that suits your project..`  print('Django Version',get_version()) ```    
In conclusion, Python's longevity and wide application have set a new standard for web development due to its robust libraries support (like NumPy/SciKit learn etc.) as well as versatility in different platforms.   Diving deeper into the specific areas of machine learning or 3D graphics will see even more breakthroughs, thanks largely from Python's core philosophy and community contributions such as TensorFlow, PyTorch , SciKit Learn are among them.

**Prompt 3/3:**
```
Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using a simple analogy.
```

**Response:**
```
Object Oriented programming (also known as OOP), is an approach where we divide our programs into objects and then connect them with each other to implement complex tasks in software design patterns are applied on real world problems or concepts, which helps programmers think more creatively about the problem at hand while writing code. 

Think of it like a classroom setting: In this context 'Object' is analogous as an individual student (Entity), and its attributes/properties can be represented by variables within that object whereas methods represent actions we perform on those objects, which are similar to procedures in normal programming languages or functions defined inside the class. 
The relationship between these Objects - students(entities) will have a link with their marks obtained through 'actions' (methods). So here every student has an id number and his/her respective mark after performing actions like addition, multiplication etc., but we can say that this interaction is connected or related to the class of entities.

```
Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using a simple analogy.
```

**Response:**
```
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can be likened to real-world object interactions in a play or movie set.

1. Entities: In OOP, objects are the entities that you create programs around. These objects represent the things in the problem domain that you want to model. For example, in a house-building simulation, some objects could be "Hammer", "Nail", and "Wood".

2. Attributes (Properties): Each object has attributes or properties, which are the characteristics of the entity. For instance, a hammer might have attributes like 'weight', 'handle_length', and 'head_size'. In our house-building simulation, each building could have an attribute like 'number_of_floors'.

3. Methods (Actions): Just like actors in a play perform actions, objects in OOP perform actions through methods. These are functions specific to that object. For example, the hammer might have a method called "hammer" which is used to drive nails into the wood. In the house-building simulation, you could have a method for a builder object like "build_house".

4. Classes: Actors in a play usually belong to certain roles or categories (e.g., lead actor, supporting actor). Similarly, objects are created from classes, which define the blueprint of an object. A class defines what attributes and methods its instances (objects) will have. So in our example, "Hammer" is a class, and each instance of that class could be a specific hammer with certain weight and handle length.

5. Inheritance: Sometimes, you might have objects that are similar to others but slightly different. For example, a sports car and a family sedan are both types of cars, but they have differences. In OOP, this concept is represented by inheritance. A class can inherit properties and methods from another class. So if we had a "Vehicle" class, our "SportsCar" and "FamilyCar" classes could inherit its attributes and behavior, and then define their specific differences (e.g., sports cars are faster but have fewer seats).

6. Polymorphism: Finally, polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as if they were the same type in certain contexts. For example, in our house-building simulation, you could have a "tool" class and a "building material" class. Both could be used by the builder object, even though they are quite different entities.

By using these principles of OOP, your code becomes more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain over time.

**Response:**
```

I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I do not have access to information about future events or developments. However, I can provide you with some insights on what might be some of the biggest breakthroughs in Python programming based on current trends and advancements:

1. Advances in Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Python has been at the forefront of machine learning and deep learning research for several years now. With the rise of powerful libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, we can expect even more innovative breakthroughs in these fields. Possibilities include better performance, improved interpretability, and new applications of these techniques in various domains.
2. Asynchronous Programming: As Python becomes increasingly popular for building scalable and high-performance applications, there is a growing need for efficient concurrency models. Asyncio, the built-in asynchronous framework in Python, is expected to continue evolving with new features and improvements that make it easier to write concurrent code. This could lead to significant performance gains and better response times for web applications, games, and other high-performance computing tasks.
3. Type Hints and Advanced Type Systems: Type hints have become a standard feature in modern Python development, allowing developers to explicitly specify the types of variables and function arguments. However, the next big breakthrough could be the integration of advanced type systems like Haskell's or Rust's into Python. This would bring more robust type checking and inference capabilities, helping developers catch errors earlier and write more maintainable code.

While these are just a few possibilities, the future of Python programming is likely to be shaped by a combination of technological advancements, user needs, and community input. The Python ecosystem is constantly evolving, and we can expect many exciting breakthroughs in the coming years.

## Model: llama2:13b

**Prompt 3/3:**
```
Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using a simple analogy.
```

**Response:**
```

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent real-world entities and their interactions. An object is an instance of a class, which defines the properties and behaviors of the entity.

Here's a simple analogy to understand OOP:

Imagine you are hosting a party for your friends. You can think of each friend as an object, with their own properties (name, age, interests) and behaviors (talking, laughing, playing games).

Now, imagine that you want to plan the party. You need to keep track of who is coming, what games they want to play, and what snacks they like. In OOP terms, you would create a class called "Guest" with properties like "name," "age," and "interests." Each friend would be an instance of this class, so you could store their specific details as objects.

At the party, each guest has certain behaviors they can exhibit, like playing games or socializing. These behaviors would be defined by methods in the Guest class, such as "playGame()" or "chatWithFriends()." Each guest object would have its own set of behaviors based on their properties and the party context.

In this analogy, the Guest class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects that represent your friends. Each object (or guest) has its own unique properties and behaviors, but they all share the same basic structure defined by the Guest class. This approach allows you to write code that is more modular, reusable, and easier to understand, since each object has a clear and well-defined set of responsibilities.

This analogy highlights the key concepts of OOP: objects, classes, properties, behaviors, and inheritance. Objects represent real-world entities with their own unique details. Classes define the properties and behaviors of those objects. Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of related classes, so you can reuse code and avoid redundant definitions.

Now, imagine that you want to throw another party with different guests. You could simply create a new class called "VIPGuest" that inherits from the Guest class, and define additional properties and behaviors specific to these VIPs. This approach allows you to build on top of existing code and adapt it to new situations, which is one of the main benefits of OOP.
